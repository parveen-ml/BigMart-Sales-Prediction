# ðŸ›’ BigMart Sales Prediction Analysis - Regression

A machine learning regression project aimed at predicting the sales of products at BigMart stores. The goal is to analyze the features of products and store attributes to build a model that can accurately forecast item-level sales.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

BigMart collected 2013 sales data for 1,559 products across 10 different stores in various cities. Each product and store is described by several attributes. The objective is to build a predictive model that identifies patterns in sales behavior across stores and products, helping BigMart improve sales strategy.
